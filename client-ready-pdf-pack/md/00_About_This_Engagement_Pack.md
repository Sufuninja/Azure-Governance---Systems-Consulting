# Azure Environment Audit

## Engagement Deliverable Pack

**Northwind Health**  
**February 2026**

---

## Introduction

This document pack represents the complete deliverables from a comprehensive Azure environment audit engagement. The engagement assessed three Azure subscriptions encompassing production, development, and shared services workloads.

The primary objectives of this audit were to:

- Establish governance clarity through consistent naming and tagging standards
- Identify cost optimization opportunities with actionable implementation guidance
- Document architecture dependencies to support operational decision-making
- Provide a foundation for ongoing Azure governance maturity

The materials enclosed are designed to serve as both a reference and a roadmap for improving the security, efficiency, and manageability of your Azure environment.

## What This Engagement Covered

The audit encompassed four key areas:

- **Governance** — Resource organization, naming conventions, tagging standards, and ownership accountability
- **Cost Optimization** — Spending analysis, waste identification, and prioritized savings opportunities
- **Architecture Dependencies** — Application relationships, data flows, and single points of failure
- **Operational Maturity** — Change control procedures, safety guardrails, and audit methodology

## What You Will Find in This Pack

**01 — Executive Summary**  
A leadership-level overview of key findings, risks, and recommended next steps. Designed for stakeholders who need the strategic picture without technical detail.

**02 — Naming Standards and Governance**  
A complete naming convention and tag governance framework ready for immediate adoption. Includes patterns for all common Azure resource types, required tags, and enforcement guidance.

**03 — Cost Analysis and Quick Wins**  
A detailed breakdown of current Azure spending with ten prioritized optimization opportunities. Each recommendation includes estimated savings, effort level, and implementation steps.

**04 — Dependency Map Explanation**  
A visual architecture diagram illustrating how applications, data services, and infrastructure components interconnect. Includes guidance on interpreting the diagram and assessing resilience.

**05 — Audit Methodology and SOP**  
Documentation of how the audit was performed and the change control procedures that ensure safe implementation of recommendations. Provides transparency and a repeatable process for future assessments.

---

## Intended Use

This deliverable pack is designed to support multiple audiences:

**Leadership** — Use the Executive Summary and Cost Analysis to understand the strategic impact and prioritize investment decisions.

**Engineering Teams** — Use the Naming Standards and Dependency Map as reference documentation for new deployments and architecture decisions.

**Operations Teams** — Use the Audit Methodology and SOP to guide safe execution of changes and establish governance processes for ongoing maintenance.

These documents are living references. As your Azure environment evolves, they should be updated to reflect architectural changes, new services, and lessons learned from implementation.

---

## Closing

This engagement deliverable pack provides a clear picture of the current state of your Azure environment, along with practical guidance for improving governance, reducing cost, and managing risk.

The recommendations are designed to be implemented incrementally, starting with low-effort quick wins and progressing to more substantial optimizations as time and resources allow. Each change follows documented safety procedures to protect production workloads.

We appreciate the opportunity to support Northwind Health in strengthening its Azure foundation.
